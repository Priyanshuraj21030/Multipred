   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multipred.git
   ```
3. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## How to Contribute

1. **Make Changes**: Develop your changes in the feature branch.
     Enhance the ui and replace the heart disease section by breast cancer section
2. **Test the Application**:
   - Run the application locally.
   - Verify that existing features (breast cancer and diabetes prediction) work correctly.
   - Test your new changes thoroughly.
3. **Ensure Adherence to Coding Standards**: Follow the coding guidelines provided below.
4. **Commit Changes**: Use a descriptive commit message.
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push the changes to your GitHub fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines:
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Follow consistent indentation (recommended: 4 spaces).
